  <h3>Richard and Mildred Loving</h3>

  <p class="big"><img src="Lovings" alt="Richard and Mildred Loving" style="float:right;width 300px; height:300px;">
    The Lovings were an ordinary family living in the state of Virginia during the 1950s. The only thing that stood out from this
    couple was that Richard was white and Mildred was of African American and Native American decent. This was against the law in
    16 states at the time, but that did not stop them. The two had fallen in love and by the time Mildred became pregnant at the
    age 18, the two went off to get married. Knowing that it was against the law in Virginia, the two traveled to Washington D.C.
    to get married and then returned back to Virginia. Richard and Mildred saw nothing wrong with their marriage and family, but
    a lot of people did.</p>

  <h3>Violating the Law</h3>

  <p class="big">When word caught wind in their hometown that Richard and Mildred had gotten married
    out of state the law enforcement took immediate action. When the two were questioned
    in their home about their marriage, the Lovings showed the sheriff their marriage
    certificate. What they did not know was that the law in Virginia did not allow for
    white and black people to marry in another state and return back to Virginia, which is
    exactly what they had done. To them it was the only way they could have married because
    of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 that was present in Virginia. This act, also known as
    an anti-miscegenation law, prohibited any two people classified as "white" and "colored"
    from marrying one another. The Lovings were in a losing situation and Richard was taken
    away to the jail where he spent one night while Mildred had to spend several nights even
    though she was pregnant. Because of this the couple decided to plea guilty and were forced
    to leave Virginia and not able to return together for 25 years.</p>

  <h3>Loving v. Virginia</h3>

  <p class="big">After trying to stay away from Virginia and family, Richard and Mildred moved back
    to Virginia in secret. They were tired of hiding and being kept from their families.
    The Lovings searched for help to take their case to court. The American Civil Liberties
    Union offered their help and provided them with one of their lawyers. The case was
    brought in front of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. After the court did not
    overturn the original ruling,they brought the case to the Supreme Court. They argued
    that not allowing marriage between interracial couples was a violation of the Fourteenth
    Amendment since it was based solely on race. The court ruled on June 12, 1967 that the
    Racial Integrity Act was unconstitutional which created a domino effect in other states
    where the ban on interracial marriages were uplifted.
    <q>In an interview Mildred said, "What happened, we really didn't intend for it to happen. What we wanted, we wanted to come home".</q>
    In the end, the Lovings moved back home to continue their lives together and to expand their family.</p>

  <h4>Impact Today</h4>

  <p class="big">Since the ruling in 1967, there has been in an increase in the number of interracial
    marriages in the the United States. The following table compares the percent of all
    marriages that are interracial in 1970 and 2013 as well as the percent of newlyweds in
    2013 that were interracial from the Pew Research Center.</p>
